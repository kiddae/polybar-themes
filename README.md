# I have archived this repository as it is too unmaintained to be useable for anyone. You can still go to my (newly reorganized) [dotfiles](https://github.com/kiddae/dotfiles) repository.

This is a repo where i store my polybar themes.

You can just link each files of the theme to the `~/.config/polybar` directory.

I have the folder in my config directory (this way: `~/config/polybar/themes/<theme-name>`), and use this bash script to switch between them:
```shell
#!/bin/bash
ln -f -t ~/.config/polybar ~/.config/polybar/themes/$1/*
~/.config/polybar/launch.sh
```

You can check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ngynLk/dotfiles) and [scripts](https://github.com/ngynLk/scripts) for further reference. (disclaimer: it's messy)

# Important to get the themes working

**All my themes fetches their colors from `xrdb`, so in order to get the themes working, you should set them in the `~/.Xresources` or `~/.Xdefaults` file and then run `xrdb ~/.Xresources` (or `~/.Xdefaults`). You can find about the syntax [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_output_in_console#X_window_system)**

Some of them have both `i3` and `bspwm` modules, some don't, depends on when I wrote them. If you absolutely need a bar working on i3, feel free to issue or pull-request.

## san

*another screenshot*
![scrot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/san/scrot2.png "Screenshot n째2")

**Fonts used:**
+ SF Compact Text
+ Font Awesome 5 Brands
+ Material Icons
+ font-logo
+ IPAGothic (for japanese glyphs)

**Modules:**
+ `launcher` : launches a `rofi` instance, it is a script you can find in my repo.
+ `i3` : i3 workspaces, basically.
+ `mpd` : `mpd` controller
+ `spotify` : shows current playing song on  spotify (uses `playerctl`)
+ `cpu`, `memory`, `date` : pretty self-explanatory.
+ `pulseaudio` : controls volume, requires `pulseaudio` (obviously)
+ `power` : polybar-ish menu

## transparent

*screenshot*
![scrot1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/transparent/scrot.png "Screenshot")

the `san` theme as above, but with a transparent background, and slightly thicker.

## cherryblocks

*another screenshot, the reasonable borders version*
![scrot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/cherryblocks/scrot2.png "Screenshot, the reasonable borders version")

a renewed version of the theme below `blocks`. Made for tiny bitmap fonts but *thicc* bars and borders.

**Fonts used:**
+ cherry
+ Font Awesome 5
+ IPAGothic (for japanese glyphs)

modules are the same as below.

## blocks

*screenshot*
![square-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/blocks/scrot-square.png "Screenshot, in the default config of the theme")

*another one*
![scrot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/blocks/scrot2.png "Screenshot, another layout")

This one is composed of three bars. For that manner, `override-redirect` was set to `false`. So, in order to have your windows not overlapping on the bars, set your wm's top gaps to some value (I use `85`)

This theme works very well with rounded borders. To enable them, uncomment the `radius=20` lines in each bar. To have the shadows follow the shape of the bars, set `clear-shadow` to `false` in your `compton.conf`.

*screenshot, with rounded borders*
![rounded-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/blocks/scrot-rounded.png "Screenshot, with rounded borders")


**Fonts used:**
+ SF Mono
+ Font Awesome 5
+ IPAGothic (for japanese glyphs)

**Modules:**
+ `wsnumber` : displays the workspace number. It uses a script included in the repo, uses `jq` as a dependency (credits to Airblader, on some random forum). Works only on i3. For other wms, you might want to use `wmctrl` or something else.
+ `xwindow` : displays window name
+ `mpd` : mpd controller.
+ `previous`, `playpause`, `next` and `spotify` : spotify controller using `playerctl` 
+ `pulseaudio` : controls volume w/ `pulseaudio`
+ `date` : displays date and time (24h format)
+ `power` : launches a `rofi` instance, script to be found on my scripts repo (might not really look well with this theme...)
+ *(optional)* `i3` : manages i3 workspaces with some cool round icons, just place it on the `i3` bar instead of `wsnumber`. You can see it in the second screenshot

## miniblocks

*screenshot*
![scrot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/miniblocks/scrot.png "Screenshot")

*another screenshot*

## arch-blur

***I don't use this one anymore, but it's still there if you want to use it***

*full screenshot*
![full-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngynLk/polybar-themes/master/arch-blur/scrot.png "Full Screenshot")

To get that blur, you need `compton-tryone`, include `dock` in the blur section of the config and set polybar's opacity to around 85% in the `compton.conf` (see dotfiles).

+ Iosevka

+ `cpu`, `memory`, `date` : pretty self-explanatory.
